Tips on editing these files in vi

1. Open ./icon_name_to_icon_code_point_map.rs
   then in the same session, switch to file you want to edit
   use C-n and C-y in edit mode

2. This plugin currently searches for lowercase, make everything so

3. Remember to run :Tabularize over ')' and ','

4. :'<,'>!sort

5. `cargo run` in debug mode should figure out if some problems.
